## About

CryptoFlip is a student collaboration project for a web development bootcamp. The goal of the project is to demonstrate fluency with Node/Express Web Server, the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Method, relational database manipulation (MySQL), etc.

The intent of this site concept is to offer a user with little prior relevant knowledge/experience first-hand exposure to cryptocurrency trading without the risk. Cryptocurrencies have been gaining a lot of traction and momentum lately, with laymen and governments curious about its viability and volatility. CryptoFlip aims to simulate the experience of trading popular cryptocurrencies with virtual money. Users can see statistical data of popular cryptocurrencies, infer price trends, and test their investing intuition. Or indulge your gambling addiction, it's a versatile sim.
