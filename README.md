A cryptocurrency trading simulator with real-time price tracking.

## About

CryptoFlip is a student collaboration project for a web development bootcamp. The goal of the project is to demonstrate fluency with Node/Express Web Server, the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Method, relational database manipulation (MySQL), etc.

We decided to work with cryptocurrencies in a way that requires little prior knowledge about them and carries no risk
Cryptocurrencies have been gaining a lot of traction and momentum recently, with laymen and governments curious about its viability and volatility. CryptoFlip aims to simulate the experience of trading popular cryptocurrencies with virtual money. Users can see statistical data of popular cryptocurrencies, infer price trends, and test their investing intuition. Or indulge their gambling addiction, it's a versatile sim.
